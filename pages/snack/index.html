    <h1>Snaaacks</h1>
    <h2>Hungry Hungry Humans</h2>
    <p>When I'm not reaching for a bag of <a href="https://hippeas.com/collections/chips">Chickpea Chips</a> or <a href="https://veganrobs.com/">Brussels Sprout Puffs</a> maybe I'll cook up a batch of something fun. Listen... I was a healthfood kid.  The nostalgia of 'Natural Food Store' ingredients blended with the intrigue of <strong>things I wasn't allowed to have</strong> is a lot of what fuels my snacking habits:</p>
